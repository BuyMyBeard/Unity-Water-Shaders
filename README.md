This repository contains a variety of shaders and models that I have showcased in my YouTube videos. You can download and incorporate them into your own project to experiment and test their effects. Additionally, if any improvements or updates are made to the files, I will ensure to keep the repository updated so that you can always access the latest versions.

This is a simple water surface shader. The current effects include waves, ripples, and underwater effects.  
If you want to know how to use this water shader, you can check out my YouTube channel for videos about water shader.
